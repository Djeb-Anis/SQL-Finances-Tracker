**Goal** 
Design a database (Personal Finance Tracker) to track expenses, income, and budgets.
You can include features like adding transactions, categorizing expenses, and generating reports on spending habits.

**Methodology**
I will write various SQL scripts in various .sql files
Each file will be for a specific task

Once that's done, I will run the main file, which creates the database, initializes the connection, and imports all other .sql files
I will use the sqlite3 and argparse libraries
